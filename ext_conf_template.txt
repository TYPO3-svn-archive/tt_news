By default categories will be displayed only if they are found in the "General record storage page" (AKA "GRSP" or "storagePid"). If you set "useStoragePid" to "0", all categories from the pagetree will be displayed. If "useStoragePid" is set to "1" and there are no tt_news categories in the "GRSP" you won't see any categories in BackEnd forms or on the website. See tt_news manual for more information.

If no alternative label is defined and the label field is empty the text [No title] will be shown. (in TYPO3 versions below 3.8.0 this doesn't work for processed fields like 'datetime' and 'category')
