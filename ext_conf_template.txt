If "categoryTreeWidth" is set to 0 (zero) the default width will depend on the browser which displays the TYPO3 BackEnd. The default width for all browsers except IE is 280px, for IE the default width is 320px to suppress the unneeded horizontal scrollbar below the category tree.

  # cat=basic/enable/140; type=boolean; label= Localization mode for images: The image field of a localized news article is excluded by default (images are alwas taken from the record in the default language).
